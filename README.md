# Model Rocket Simulation

This project performs a simulated launch of a model rocket. The simulation results are presented on a html page, with a table and chart. 

Written in JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas. 

## Usage

Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://tolmdyn.github.io/model-rocket-sim/)


## Implementation Details

The simulation tracks air drag, net force, acceleration, velocity and altitude, along with a modelling the effects of a timed parachute ejection.

The rocket and simulation parameters can be adjusted, for different model rockets. The specifications of different Estes motors can be found online, for example [here](https://courses.washington.edu/engr100/All_Sections/Rocket/HTML%20Handouts/01b_hnd_engine_chart.pdf) or on the Estes website.

The program idea and equations used are mostly based on the resources provided by Randy Culp at [RocketMime](https://www.rocketmime.com), specifically [this](https://www.rocketmime.com/rockets/rckt_eqn.html) page, along with the spreadsheet and Java applet source hosted on the same website.
